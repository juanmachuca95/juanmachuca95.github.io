    <description><![CDATA[<p>📝 A lot of water passed under the bridge since Generics came to Golang. This water did not pass in front of me, but today, together, let&rsquo;s rediscover &ldquo;Generics&rdquo; 💪.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-generics">What is Generics?</h1>
<p>Go is a statically and strongly typed programming language. This means that variables must be declared with a specific type and this type cannot change during program execution. In addition, operations on variables and expressions must be type compatible.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have to say that my relationship with the goruntins not is the bests, However, I am deeply attracted to gorutins.</p>
<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s skip the romantic part and get down to the nitty-gritty.</p>

<p>I have a dream? Yes, this question should be &ldquo;I have a problem&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not enought funny to admit that I do.</p>
